# Scrappy

Scrappy the Scrapper V2

Using ephemeral github actions Scrappy performs & process file scraping from some pdf file location and then sends its data to a destination.

At first Scrappy will receive a PDF file name and process as a file Url but could be extended to read from a file blob or other pdf file sources and upstreams.

At first Scrappy output is JSON but can be converted and extended to provide all manner of formats and contract types and downstreams upon input
